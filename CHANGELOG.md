- `INSTALL.md`, `USAGE.md`, `README.md` — full documentation
- `protected-systems.md` — the 14 protected systems
- `baseline.sha` — locked baseline record (1,000,593 bytes, SHA `7b6c4dc9...`)

**The methodology (rules for working):**
- `methodology/ponytail-core.md` — Ponytail lazy-senior-dev mode

### Verification

- ✅ 11/11 vitest tests pass
- ✅ bootstrap.sh syntax valid
- ✅ All scripts/*.js files have valid JS syntax
- ✅ PROTECTED_KEYWORDS.js loads (130 keywords)
- ✅ Methodology docs complete

### Provenance

This repository was created during the consolidation work of 2026-06-21, after the locked baseline `gridnode-v1.3_post-phase-D_baseline.html` was finalized at SHA `7b6c4dc9025aa07bb336edd0eb28cf76a3bd14cff7393aa19a01cb26428e6660` (1,000,593 bytes).

The methodology was co-developed with Claude (Anthropic) over 5 rounds of convergence. See `methodology/flex-directive-v5.md` for the full history.

## Versioning

- **Major version (1.x → 2.x):** methodology breaks (new lane added, protected systems change)
- **Minor version (1.0 → 1.1):** additive features (new docs, new tools, new examples)
- **Patch version (1.1.0 → 1.1.1):** bug fixes, copy edits, no behavior change

When bumping versions:
1. Update this CHANGELOG.md
2. Update the version field in any relevant docs
3. Commit with a clear message: "Bump to v1.x.y"
4. Push — CI will run automatically
